          Iâ€™m an aspiring journalist studying at the University of Northern Colorado. I specialize in digital and
          broadcast writing as well as photography. My time at UNC has strengthened my storytelling and writing skills
          tremendously. I have also had many opportunities to create and publish my various journalistic works while
          working as a UNC Athletics PR Intern as well as a student journalist for the UNC Mirror.
